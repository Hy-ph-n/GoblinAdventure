# GoblinAdventure
Goblin Adventure is a python-made program where the player is a goblin looking for gold in a dangerous environment filled with barrier walls and bombs. Players must avoid bombs and navigate past walls to collect enough coins to win. If the player hits a bomb too many times, they will lose.
